# Gamma Controls

## Introduction

Change Gamma settings with hotkeys that are set in the CET bindings, and also through ImGui sliders. Useful to figure out the right gamma according to your display especially when using certain lighting mods that darken/brighten the scene over vanilla game.

## Installation

1. Copy the "bin" to your "\Cyberpunk 2077\" game folder.
2. Set the hotkeys in "Bindings" of your CET window.

The files will be located under the following directories:

```
\Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\GammaControls
```
